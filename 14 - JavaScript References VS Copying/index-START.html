    // console.log(age, age2); // Returns 100 100

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];



    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    const team = players;

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // team[3] = 'Lux';

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // console.log(players, team);

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    const team2 = team.slice();

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    const team3 = [].concat(team);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    const team4 = [...team];

    // also Array.from()

    const team5 = Array.from(team);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    team2[2] = 'Garen';
    team3[2] = 'Darius';
    team4[2] = 'Trynadmere';
    team5[2] = 'Malzahar';
    // console.log(team, team2, team3, team4, team5); // All of them are different

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    const captain = person;
    // captain.number = 99;
    // console.log(person, captain);

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, captain, { number: 99 });
    console.log(person, captain, captain2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    const captain3 = {...captain};
    captain3.age = 69;

    console.log(person, captain, captain2, captain3);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'Wes Bos'

    }
