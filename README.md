# JavaScript30-Challenges
My solutions for all of the JavaScript 30 challenges from Wes Bos

I'm only including the finished files that I actaully had a part in editing, for the sake of not clogging up unnecessary file space. 

The repos that these files actually belong with can be found at is: https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30 

Just replace the index-START.html files, since I was too lazy to rename them.

Just checking to make sure this works.
